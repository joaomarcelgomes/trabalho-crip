Imagine we intercept this scrambled message. The challenge is to decipher it. We know that the text is in English and that it has been scrambled according to a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, but we have no idea of the key. Searching all possible keys is impractical, so we must apply frequency analysis. What follows is a step-by-step guide to cryptanalyzing the ciphertext, but if you feel confident, you may prefer to skip this and attempt your own independent cryptanalysis.
